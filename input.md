## The `input` function

Text can be read from the keyboard with the `input` function. `input` works with and without a message text. The value returned is always a string:

    a = input()
    b = input('Please enter a number')

Although the `input` command is rarely seen in big programs, it often helps to write small, understandable programs, especially while learning Python.
