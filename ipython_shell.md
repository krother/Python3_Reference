# The IPython shell

The IPython shell allows you to enter Python commands one by one and executes them promptly.
The IPython shell is a luxury version of the simpler Python shell. It is also called *interactive mode* or *interactive Python command line*.

You can use any Python command from the *IPython Shell*:

    In [1]: 1 + 1
    Out[1]: 2
    In [2]: 4 * 16
    Out[2]: 64
    In [3]:

Results of each command are automatically printed to the screen.

## How to leave the IPython shell?

* You can leave the command line by Ctrl-z (Windows) or Ctrl-d (Linux).
* If a program seems to be stuck, you can interrupt the shell with Ctrl-c.

## Magic Methods

The IPython shell has a number of special commands or **Magic Methods**. Here are the most common ones:

* `%run` - execute a program
* `%paste` - paste and execute code from the clipboard
* `%hist` - show recently entered commands
* `ls` - show files in the current directory
* `pwd` - print the current working directory
* `cd <dir>` - change the working directory to `<dir>`
