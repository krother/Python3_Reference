# Numbers

## Integer numbers

Numerical values without decimal places are called **integers** or **ints**. In Python, integers are a predefined **data type**.

    >>> a = 42


## Floating-point numbers

Numbers with decimal places are called **floating-point numbers** or **floats**. 

    >>> b = 42.0
    >>> pi = 3.14159


## Arithmetical Operators

The arithmetical symbols like `+ - * /` connecting two numbers are called **operators**. In addition to the standard arithmetics a few other operators are available:

    a = 7
    b = 4
    c = a - b      
    d = a * b      
    e = a / b      
    f = a % b      # modulo, 3
    g = a ** 2     # 49   
    h = 7.0 // b   # floor division, 1.0

If you perform arithmetics with integer numbers, the result is also an integer. If one of the numbers is a float, the result will also be a float.
When you perform a division, the result is always a floating-point number.
