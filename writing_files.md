# Writing text files

## Opening a file for writing

Writing text to files is very similar to reading. One main difference is that you need to add the `'w'` parameter for *writing*.

    f = open('my_file.txt','w')
    f.write(text)
    f.close()

## Writing a list of strings

If your data is a list of strings, it can be written to a file in one line of code. You only need to take care of adding line breaks at the end of each line:

    lines = ['first line\n', 'second line\n']
    open('my_file.txt','w').writelines(lines)


## Writing a table to a text file

A straightforward pattern to write multiple columns to a file uses a `for` loop to create lines with separators and newline characters:

    names = ['Emily', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
    ages = [23, 45, 67]

    f = open('my_file.txt', 'w')
    for name, age in zip(names, ages):
        line = "{};{}\n".format(name, age)
        f.write(line)
    f.close()

Like with reading, the `csv` and `pandas` offer more sophisticated ways to write tables.


## Appending to a file

It is possible to append text to an existing file, too.

    f = open('my_file.txt','a')
    f.write('line appended at the end\n')
    f.close()


## Closing a file after writing

When writing data, Python *buffers* the data and writes it to the disk with a delay. The writing occurs after the file has been closed, when Python ends or when the buffer runs full. By using `close()` you make sure the data gets written.

    f.close()

## Writing to a file with a Context Manager

The `with` statement is a **Context Manager** that takes care of closing a file automatically:

    with open('my_file', 'w') as f:
        f.write('line of text\n')
