## Type conversions

If you have an integer number `i`, you can make a string out of it with `str(i)`:

    text = str(2000)

If you have a string `s`, you can make an integer out of it with `int(s)`:

    number = int("2000")

Both `int()` and `str()` change the type of the given data. They are therefore called **type conversions**.

## Functions

With `int()` and `str()`, you have just learned to know two **functions**. In Python, functions consist of a *name* followed by **parentheses**. They can have parameters, so that a function is used like:

    y = f(x)

Using a function is a regular Python statement (or part thereof). It is executed only once
