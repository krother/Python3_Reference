# Introspection

Introspection is a feature of Python by which you can examine objects (including variables, functions, classes, modules) inside a running Python environment (a program or shell session).

## Exploring the namespace

In Python all objects (variables, modules, classes, functions and your main program) are boxes called **namespaces**. You can imagine the namespace of an object as the data and functions inside than object. You can explore a namespace with the `dir()` function.

### Exploring the namespace of a variable

With a string object, you see all the string methods:

    :::python
    s = "Emily"
    print(dir(s))

### Exploring the namespace of a module:

The same works for a module you import:

    :::python
    import time
    print(dir(time))


### Listing the builtin functions:

You also can view all builtin functions:

    :::python
    print(dir(__builtins__))



## The help function

You can get context-sensitive help to functions, methods and classes with `help()` function.

    :::python
    import time
    print help(time.asctime)

`help()` utilizes the triple-quoted comments called **docstrings**, so that documentation you write for your own functions is also availabel through `help()`:


## Everything is an object

One consequence of the dynamic typing is that Python can treat everything it manages technically in the same way. **Everything is an object** is a common phrase describing how Python works. There is no fundamental difference between a function and an integer. Many advanced features of Python are built on this concept.
