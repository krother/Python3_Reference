## Lists versus Dictionaries

Which is better, lists or dictionaries?

Generally, **lists are good for sorting** while **dictionaries are good for searching**. 


## The None value

The `None` data type is used when a function does not have a return statement. You can also use it to indicate that some position in a list or dictionary is empty:

    traffic_light = [None, None, 'green']



## Installing additional Python modules

There are more than 75,000 additional modules/packages for Python available. The most common ones are already installed with the **Anaconda** distribution. The next best solution is to install Python modules using `pip`. `pip` is a program designed to make installing modules easy. For instance, to install the `pandas` library, you can type on a **terminal** (not the Python shell):

    pip install pandas

Depending on your system configuration, this may require administrator privileges.
