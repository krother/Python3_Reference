INDEXING

summary: computers and people count differently.

explanation: computers treat an address in memory as the *starting point* of a body of data. In the same sense, an *indexes* in Python always refers to such a starting point, something that is *in between* two objects in memory. We humans in contrast always count the objects themselves.
