# Python 3 Beginners Reference

(c) 2016 Dr. Kristian Rother (krother@academis.eu)


## Who is this document for?

This document contains brief descriptions and examples of common Python commands. You can use it to review your knowledge, look up things quickly and accompany a beginners course on Python 3.

This document is meant to help people learning Python as their first programming language. Because of that, it contains many commands and expressions a seasoned programmer might write differently. But I consider them nevertheless helpful to learn programming.

This document is not intended as an in-depth guide. Please refer to [www.python.org/doc](http://www.python.org/doc) for more detailed information.
