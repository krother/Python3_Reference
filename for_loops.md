# Loops with for

The `for` loop allows you to repeat one or more instructions. To write a `for` loop you need two things: First a **sequence-like object **(e.g. a list, a string, a dictionary or the output of a function producing sequences). Second, a **variable** that takes different values as the loop iterates over the sequence. The variable is easier, because it doesn't matter what name you give it.

Things you can iterate over with `for` loops:

* strings (character by character)
* lists
* dictionaries
* files (line by line)
* iterable functions (`range`, `sorted`, `reversed`)

Loops with `for` are useful whenever you want to repeat instructions a known number of times, or when you wnat to do something for *all* elements of a sequence. Below you find some examples.


## Loops executing a given number of times

With the `range()` function, you can set the number of iterations easily:

    for i in range(7):
        print(i)

or using an interval:

    for i in range(10, 17):
        print(i)

or backwards:

    for i in range(17, 10, -1):
        print(i)


## Loops over a string

With a string as the sequence, you obtain single characters in each iteration.

    for char in 'ABCD':
        print(char)


## Loops over a list

A list iterates simply once through each element:

    for elem in [1, 22, 333, 4444, 55555]:
        print(elem)


## Loops over a dictionary

With a dictionary, the `for` loop iterates over the keys. Note that the dictionary is inherently unordered. Theoretically, you could get the keys in a different order each time.

    pairs = {'Alice': 'Bob', 'Ada': 'Charlie', 'Visual': 'Basic'}
    for key in pairs:
        print(key)
        print(pairs[key])


## Looping over two lists simultaneously

Sometimes, you want to look up corresponding items from two lists. A straightforward solution is to loop over an index:

    names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Delia']
    jobs = ['admin', 'builder', 'cook', 'developer']

    for i in range(4):
        print(names[i] + ' works as a ' + jobs[i])

However, the *pythonic* solution would be to use `zip`:

    for name, job in zip(names, jobs):
        print(name + ' works as a ' + job)


## Indented block

All indented commands after the colon are executed *within* a `for` loop. The first unindented command is executed after the loop finishes.

    for i in range(5):
        print('inside')
        print('also inside')
    print('outside')
