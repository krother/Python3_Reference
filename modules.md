# Modules and Packages

## Modules

Any Python file (ending with `.py`) can be imported by Python script. A single Python file is also called a **module**. This helps you to divide a bigger program into several smaller pieces.

For instance if you have a file `names.py` containing the following:

    FIRST_NAMES = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

Then you can write (e.g. in a second Python file in the same directory):

    import names
    print(names.FIRST_NAMES)



## Packages

For big programs, it is useful to divide up the code among several directories. A directory from which you can import Python modules is called a package. To create a package that Python will recognize you need to create a file `__init__.py` (it may be empty).

For instance, you could have the following files in a package `namedata`:

    namedata/
        __init__.py
        names.py


## Importing modules and packages

To import from a module, a package or their contents, place its name (without .py) needs to be given in the import statement. Import statements can look like this:

    import names
    import names as n
    from names import FIRST_NAMES
    from namedata.names import FIRST_NAMES

It is strongly recommended to list the imported variables and functions explicitly and not write

    from names import *

The latter makes debugging difficult.

When importing, Python generates intermediate files (bytecode) in the `__pycache__` directory that help to execute programs more efficiently. It is managed automatically, and you can safely ignore it.


## How does Python find modules and packages?

When importing modules or packages, Python needs to know where to find them. There is a certain sequence of directories in which Python looks for things to import:

* The current directory.
* The site-packages folder (where Python is installed).
* In directories in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

You can see all directories from within Python by checking the `sys.path` variable:

    import sys
    print sys.path
