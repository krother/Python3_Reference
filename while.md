# Conditional loops with while

Another control flow statement is the **conditional loop** with `while`. While loops combine the properties `for` and `if`. The loop is executed as long as the conditional expression at the beginning holds. The conditional expressions work in exactly the same way as in `if` statements.

## Counting until a certain value

A simple usage of while is to count until an exit condition is met. The following loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 through 10:

    i = 0
    total = 0
    while i < 10:
        print(i)
        i = i + 1
        total = total + i


## Searching through data

With a `while` loop you can perform search operations - although many times the methods on lists and dictionaries will give you a shortcut.

The following loop finds the first name starting with an `'E'`:

    data = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Emily', 'Fred']
    i = 0
    while i < len(data) and not data[i].startswith('E'):
        i += 1
    print(i)


## Waiting for user input

A `while` loop is also useful to let a user stop the program:

    number = 0
    while input('press [Enter] to continue or [x] to exit') != 'x':
        number = number +1
        print(number)


## Endless loops

With `while` it is possible to build loops that never stop. Most of the time this happens by accident. In the following loop, the instruction to decrease `a` is missing. It runs endlessly:

    a = 10
    b = 1
    while a > 0:
        b = 1 - b
        print(b)
