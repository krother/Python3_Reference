# Functions

## What is a function?

A function is an autonomous sub-program with local variables, input and output. Functions help you divide a program into smaller logical portions. It is much easier to write, reuse and debug a program consisting of many small functions than a single huge blob of code.

In Python, a function definition must be followed by a code block:

    def calc_price(fruit, n):	
        '''Returns the price of fruits.'''
        if fruit == 'banana':
            return 0.75 * n

    print(calc_price('banana', 10))


## Obligatory and optional parameters

Each function can have **obligatory** parameters (that *must* be given when calling the function and **optional** parameters that have default values. The following function can be called in two ways:

    def calc_price(fruit, n=1): 
        '''Returns the price of fruits.'''
        if fruit == 'banana':
            return 0.75 * n

    print(calc_prices('banana'))
    print(calc_prices('banana', 100))

#### Warning

Do not use *mutable* default values (e.g. lists and dictionaries) in the function header. They make a mess!

## List and keyword parameters

For even greater flexibility with function parameters you can also add a list `*args` for an unspecified number of extra parameters, or a dictionary `**kwargs` for keyword parameters. 

    def func(*args, **kwargs):
        print(args[1])
        print(kwargs['a'])

    func(1, 2, a=3, b=4)

This example may be a bit hard to digest, but these kinds of parameters are used widely.

## Return values

A function may return values to the program part that called it. 

    return 0.75

Multiple values are returned as a tuple. 

    return 'banana', 0.75

In any case, the `return` statement ends the execution of a function. Nothing speaks against having multiple `return` statements in a function (although for clarity it should not be too many).
