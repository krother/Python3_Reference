## Variables

**Variables** are *'named containers'* used to store values within Python. Variable names may be composed of letters, underscores and, after the first position, also digits.
Lowercase letters are common, uppercase letters are usually used for constants like `PI`.

Variables can be used for calculating in place of the values they contain.

## Variable assignments

The operator `=` is used in Python to define a variable. A Python statement containing an `=` is called a **variable assignment**. The value on the right side of the equal sign will be stored in a variable with the name on the left side.


## Changing variables

You may assign to the same variable name twice:

    In [1]: emily = 25952
    In [2]: emily = 222
    In [3]: emily
    Out[3]: 222

In this case, the first value is overwritten by the second assignment. There is no way to obtain it afterwards.


## Python Statements

The lines you are writing all the time are also called Python **Statements**. A Statement is the smallest executable piece of code.

So far, you have seen at least three different kinds of statements:

* Calculate a number
* Put a number into a variable
* Print the number from a variable on the screen
